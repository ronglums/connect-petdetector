    "\n",
    "With support for TensorBoard.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to take a Inception v3 or Mobilenet model trained on\n",
    "ImageNet images, and train a new top layer that can recognize other classes of\n",
    "images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top layer receives as input a 2048-dimensional vector (1001-dimensional for\n",
    "Mobilenet) for each image. We train a softmax layer on top of this\n",
    "representation. Assuming the softmax layer contains N labels, this corresponds\n",
    "to learning N + 2048*N (or 1001*N)  model parameters corresponding to the\n",
    "learned biases and weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example, which assumes you have a folder containing class-named\n",

    "The subfolder names are important, since they define what label is applied to\n",
    "each image, but the filenames themselves don't matter. Once your images are\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain && \\\n",

    "    --image_dir ~/flower_photos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can replace the image_dir argument with any folder containing subfolders of\n",
    "images. The label for each image is taken from the name of the subfolder it's\n",
    "in.\n",

    "This produces a new model file that can be loaded and run by any TensorFlow\n",
    "program, for example the label_image sample code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default this script will use the high accuracy, but comparatively large and\n",
    "slow Inception v3 model architecture. It's recommended that you start with this\n",
    "to validate that you have gathered good training data, but if you want to deploy\n",
    "on resource-limited platforms, you can try the `--architecture` flag with a\n",
    "Mobilenet model. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "```\n",
